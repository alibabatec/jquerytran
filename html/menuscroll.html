			<pre>DMK leader and Karunanidhi's daughter Kanimozhi cast her 
			vote in Tamil Nadu and said that the Election
			Commission had not taken enough action against those accused 
			of distributing money to voters.
			"DMK has been consistently saying that there is a lot of distirubtion

			like EC is really probing to find answers. 
			If CBI inquiry is the only way out, we should do that," she added.
			However, when asked about what she thought about the fact that allegations of bribery had been made against 
			DMK leaders too, Kanimozhi gave a different answer. "We really don't know. There could be other explanations also.
			But we're not trying to protect anybody," she said.
